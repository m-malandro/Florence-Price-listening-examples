Here are the listening examples mentioned in the paper. There are 1400 of them: 20 melodies * 2 models * 35 generations per melody per model:

Each example was generated by supplying the melody to a symbolic music model and asking the model to write a piano accompaniment. One model was a baseline model ([Composer's Assistant v2.1.0](https://github.com/m-malandro/composers-assistant-REAPER) fine-tuned on the [OpenScore Lieder Corpus](https://github.com/OpenScore/Lieder)) and the other model was our model (Composer's Assistant v2.1.0 fine-tuned on the Florence Price Art Song Dataset linked above). The examples include the melodies along with the generated accompaniments.
