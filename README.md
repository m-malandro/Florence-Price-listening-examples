Please see the releases to download the listening examples. There are 1400 of them: 20 melodies * 2 models * 35 generations per melody per model:

Each example was generated by supplying the melody to a symbolic music model and asking the model to write a piano accompaniment. One model was a baseline model (fine-tuned on the [OpenScore Lieder Corpus](https://github.com/OpenScore/Lieder)) and the other model was our model (fine-tuned on the Florence Price Art Song Dataset linked above). The examples include the melodies along with the generated accompaniments.
