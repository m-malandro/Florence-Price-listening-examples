# Florence-Price-listening-examples

This repository is a companion to the ISMIR 2025 paper "The Florence Price Art Song Dataset and Piano Accompaniment Generator"

Please see the releases to download up to 1400 listening examples. Each example was generated by supplying the melody to a symbolic music model and asking the model to write a piano accompaniment. One model was a baseline model (fine-tuned on the [OpenScore Lieder Corpus](https://github.com/OpenScore/Lieder) and the other model was our model (fine-tuned on the Florence Price Art Song Dataset). 

If you use these samples for research, please cite our paper:
